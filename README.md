# <ins> Gaming Carbon Footprint Tracker (Prototype) </ins>

This project is a prototype application designed to explore sustainability in gaming and computing.
It allows users to log gaming sessions and estimate carbon emissions based on device usage.

### Features

Track gaming sessions

Estimate carbon footprint based on device type

View session history and basic analytics

Access sustainability tips and daily challenges

Some example session data is included.

### How It Works

Users record gaming sessions (duration, device, target time)

Carbon emissions are calculated using average energy consumption values

Calculated values (such as emissions and averages) are not saved and are recalculated when data is loaded

A simple text-based save system is used

### Running the Program

Console-based application

Intended to be run in Debug mode only

Running in Release mode is not supported or tested

### Limitations

Carbon calculations are estimates based on average values

Analytics are basic and intended for prototype demonstration

Not intended as an accurate scientific measurement tool

## Future Development

Improved analytics

Better save system

More detailed emission calculations
